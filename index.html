                                <p>Hi Readers, welcome to my development pod space, here you would will find data engineering and science based technical resources and conceptual blogs highlighting every design aspect of a data science project.</p>
                                <p>Hope dev pod site along with my git repositories would help in contributing to the open source platform, also my hope is that the content out here helps support fellow data science peers who are either new to this field or are already jedi masters.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/dYCech.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>
                                <p> Cool visualization on top highly resonates with my perception of data around us. As a data enthusiast I see it everwhere, as we live in this fast paced digital world we all are contributing to either creation,manipulation, or distribution of new or historical data. If you are in the same boat as me, then like me you too want to understand thr technology behind it, through which we create logical patterns and scenarios that helps answer critical or complex questions we would have in our mind.</p>
                                
                <p>Above statement co-relates to the science aspect of data analysis, engineering then follows through, regardless of the technology platform we choose to leverage to solve any pattern/business decision analysis. Engineering and Science go in pair, any dumb person can figure that one out.
								</p>

                                My objective here is to share my thoughts,ideas, technical examples, and program codes with you all to collborat and grow my skills down the line. I am excited and looking forward to this partnership with my fellow readers and github members. Dhanyavaad !
