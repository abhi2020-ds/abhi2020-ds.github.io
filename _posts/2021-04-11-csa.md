<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My familiarity with R is new, roughly close to 2 years now. I have been exploring several use cases where I can leverage R as a preferred platform for data analytics compared to other tools I am familiar with. Few weeks back, I found a great use case, conducting exploratory data analysis on customer reviews for local Pizza Restaurants ! Around the globe, Industries are assigning customer sentiments based analytics projects to their team of data engineering and data science experts, using sources from several media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Zomato and Yelp. Through REST APIs one can extract data from web plaforms and perform meaningful analytics. BI pipelines leveraging API calls on web resources can help in tracking all customer reviews, and help isolate negative sentiments ; based on gathered results ,take action towards suitable resolution. Why analysis on Pizza Restaurants? This quote says it all :</p>

    <blockquote>Never sit around and wait for someone unless they’re delivering a <b>Pizza</b> ! &#128513; </blockquote>

<h2>R Markdown</h2>

<p> 
In layman terms , if you want to save time as use as less tags as possible but get the same look and feel of a HTML document, utilize R Markdown. Now I can spin my reasoning several ways technically, to tell you why markdown is way better than HTML in case where you need quick an easy way to represent your data analytics information on web. 
</p>

<p> 
R Markdown specifically was designed keeping "ease of use" developer sentiments on mind. An easy way of projecting data and visuals on browser without using complex HTML coding. 2012 R Markdown was first introduced in "knitr" package.
</p>

<h3>Customer Sentiment Dashboard</h3>
<p>One of the presentation features that R language offers is "Flexboard". Using Flexboard you can embed your code chunks and html widgets together into an appealing dashboard. See below flexboard I have created identifying customer reviews and ratings on local restaurants.</p>

      <iframe class="" rel="nofollow" style="height: 1000px; width: 4000px; transform: scale(0.294167) !important; transform-origin: 0px 0px;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"

<h3>Tool Highlight</h3>
<p><span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/Top Menu.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>ThoughtSpot Menu Options consists of : Search, Answer, Pinboard, Data, SpotIQ and Admin Tabs.</p>

<h3>Search : </h3>
<p> <span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/Search.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Search feature helps create Answers and Pinboards. Source is used in the form of Worksheets, Views and Raw Tables. Search capability is extremely intuitive and can find data fields from the sources automatically within search bar.  Tool automatically generates most apt visual for data representation, but also gives flexibility to pick the visual of your choice in chart configuration section. If users like their search results, those searches can be saved in the form of <i>"Answers"</i>, users can pin collection of visuals into a consolidated <i>"Pinboard"</i>. Owners of Answer or Pinboard contents can share these objects with other members by assigning them view or edit permissions. Users can also perform complex nested searches, this search within a search functionality can account for complex  business questions.
</p>

<h3>Answers & Pinboards: </h3>
<p> <span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/Answers.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>Answers and Pinboards tabs are collection of all saved Searches. Answers can also be transformed into <i>Materialzed Views</i>, these views can be scheduled for refreshes and can  directly sourced in a  Worksheet. This provides end users flexibility to reuse their existing analytics contents. Pinboards contains collection of meanigful visuals that are saved within Answers. Pinboards main advantage is that user's analysis can span across multiple back end sources and can be represented in form of a single collection. Answers and Pinbaords, or any data object within Thoughtspot can be organized by leveraging <i><b>stickers</b></i>. Using Stickers analytics content can be managed by categories such as line of business, or subject areas that analytics team is accustomed to classify their business process. Another capability called <b>"Ask an Expert"</b> feature lets business users ask technical questions about the data in use to the data owner of the content.
</p>

<h3>SpotIQ: </h3>
<p> <span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/SpotIQ.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>SpotIQ is AI/ML feature that ThoughtSpot has built for users to get more insights into their existing search/answers. SpotIQ will provide several recommendations and also give data visuals on comparisons such as Linear/Logistic Regressions on the searched data. SpotIQ based data representations can be used in Pinboards is an added plus.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>
<p> ThoughtSpot is attracting data analytics enthusiasts from leading industries. It's highlight feature of being a Search Based Analytics tool (augmented analytics) with a strong recommender system is catching attention across industries. As ThoughtSpot continues to diversify its capabilities further, currently its emphasis is on reporting on cloud datasource, however ThoughtSpot should try to expand data connections to other conventional data sources that industries are familiar with and using at large scale. Also emphasizing on adding more visuals will go long way to compete with competitors PowerBI, Tableau and Qlik. <b>Dataflow</b> is getting there with managing ETL processes internally for the tool, but needs to mature more. Also some level of maturity is needed to improving error classifications for debugging and troubleshooting. </p>
<p>If your data analytics team is transforming into cloud ecosystem then this tool should be considered best option you got apart from PowerBI, Tableau, and Qlik. Data preparation and data load within TS is a topic of discussion for some other time. Overall a thumbs up to this reporting tool and highly recommend fellow data experts to leverage this tool within their industry in some fashion.
