<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My familiarity with R is new, roughly close to 2 years now. I have been exploring several use cases where I can leverage R as a preferred platform for data analytics compared to other tools I am familiar with. Few weeks back, I found a great use case, conducting <b>exploratory data analysis</b> on customer reviews for local Pizza Restaurants ! Around the globe, Industries are assigning customer sentiments based analytics projects to their team of data engineering and data science experts, using sources from several media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Zomato and Yelp. Through <b>REST APIs</b> one can extract data from web plaforms and perform meaningful analytics. BI pipelines leveraging API calls on web resources can help in tracking all customer reviews, and help isolate negative sentiments ; based on gathered results ,take action towards suitable resolution. Why analysis on Pizza Restaurants? This quote says it all :</p>

    <blockquote>Never sit around and wait for someone unless theyâ€™re delivering a <b>Pizza</b> ! &#128513; </blockquote>

<h2>R Markdown</h2>

<p> 
In layman terms , if you want to save time and use less tags as possible but get the same look and feel of a HTML document, utilize <b>R Markdown</b>. Now I can spin my reasoning several ways technically, to tell you why markdown is way better than HTML in case where you need quick an easy way to represent your data analytics information on web. 
</p>

<p> 
R Markdown specifically was designed keeping <b>"ease of use"</b> developer sentiments on mind. An easy way of projecting data and visuals on browser without using complex HTML coding. 2012 R Markdown was first introduced in "knitr" package.
</p>

<h3>Customer Sentiment Dashboard</h3>
<p>One of the presentation features that R language offers is <i><b>Flexboard</b></i>. Using Flexboard you can embed your code chunks and html widgets together into an appealing dashboard. See below flexboard I have created identifying customer reviews and ratings on local restaurants.</p>
