<h2>The Big Three</h2>
Year 2008 I was about to graduate from bachelors program, there was sense of relief that I can now move on to experience professional world. It was also the year when I was introduced to my favorite sport Tennis. Back then I knew few famous athletes but never closely followed the sport. When Wimbledon finals were building up it was clear that Federer and Rafa were going to face each other, it was a hype train, and I was onboard for two reasons : 
 - <b>Roger Federer</b> was at that time chasing history, if he won, he would  tie with <b>Pete Sampras</b> for most grand slams <i>(14)</i> in Mens Tennis.
 - <b>Rafael Nadal</b>, his opponent, was attempting to make his mark in Wimbledon winner's circle after recently winning French Open for the 4th time. Sports Pundits called him a clay court specialist : <b>King Of Clay</b>. He was chasing a rare French Open - Wimbledon double feat which was rare to achieve as it required player to switch from clay to grass surface. If you play this sport for recreation or follow pro tennis matches you know that it is extremely difficult to switch surfaces, adapt and win it all the way is a big bask and many failed in the past.  
 
 2008 Wimbledon Finals turned out to be a classic <b>4 hr 48 mins</b> marathon, to date it is considered to be one of the best matches witnessed in tennis history. Nadal prevailed, a rivarly was born which continued for decades. These two became tennis role models and fans picked only two sides in tennis either Roger or Rafa.

<b>Novak Djokovic</b> on the other hand had just won his first slam that year in Australian Open, first Serbian to win a slam. He was a great player, still  considered a funny fella, cracking jokes, doing spectacular job imitating other players during post match ceremonies. He lacked mental temprament to compete with Roger and Rafa back then. That soon changed when 2011 he started pushing his limits and started winning more slams. Today they are referred to as <b>"The Big 3"</b> of tennis world, sharing total of <b>59 slams !</b>

<h2>Data Analytics Idea</h2>
Being passionate about data analytics and science, I wanted to gather useful data to analyze and project their carrer graph. To further build a race chart showcasing their progression and succession to the top of this sport. After going through several alternatives I decided to use <b>Python</b> as the preferred language to tell this story.

And here is the story ! Slam race from year 2008 - 2021.

<h2>Why Beautiful Soup?</h2>
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/BeautifulSoup/BSlogo.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> 
In order to simulate an accurate trend visual, I had to get this data from a reliable source. In this case was it was the official tennis ATP website. The online repository has wide range of history for all tennis players and their matches for every tournament played. Challenge was to seamlessly navigate through web and get desired extracted intormation. Enters Beautiful Soup ! For a quick analytics project turnaround and to scrape literally anything you give to your parser, this library provided by Python is the most diverse package you can ask for, because :
- Beautiful Soup makes page's tree traverse and searching easy.
- This library automatically converts encoding types to best suit your need.
- This library sits on top of other Python libraries like lxml and html5lib

Many big data and data science projects time to time requires web scraping and Beautiful Soup library helps developers with that process. Interesting fact, the name of the package was inspired from a song that was in <i>Alice's Advantures In The Wonderland</i>

<h3>Tennis Grand Slams</h3>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Total Titles</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Roger Federer</td>
                <td>20</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Rafael Nadal</td>
                <td>20</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Novak Djokovic</td>
                <td>19</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
        <tfoot>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2"></td>
                <td>59</td>
            </tr>
        </tfoot>

<h3>Inspecting Web Page </h3>
They key to gathering information from web is understanding tree structure of your target webpage. This helps in extracting information such as query pattern, HTML table content and other elements par of the page. You can use any browser tool to get HTML content view, I recommend Chrome's Inspect Element feature. Simply right click on your browser and select "Inspect", it opens up developer tool window displaying HTML content.

<span class="image fit"><img src="{{ "/images/BeautifulSoup/Inspect.png" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

You can inspect DOM and CSS pattern using this feature and understand page tree structure.

<h3>Data Manipulation & Visualization </h3>
Extracting data from a site majority of time would also require transformation. Extracted data needs to be cleaned further for analytics and visualization purpose. This example uses pandas, bar_chart_race and pandas_alive libraries to achieve transformation and visualization steps.

<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Install required packages using <b>pip install</i></li>
    <li>Use request library to initiate URL connection</li>
    <li>Use beautiful soup library to find html content from the page</li>
    <li>Store extract in Dataframe using Pandas</li>
    <li>Use race chart and pandas alive library to create a gif and video extract of the data</li>
</ul>
