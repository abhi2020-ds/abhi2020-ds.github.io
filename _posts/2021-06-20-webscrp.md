<h2>The Big Three</h2>
2008 was the year when I was introduced to Tennis. I was familiar to the sport and knew name of famous tennis athletes but never closely followed it. During <b>Wimbledon Slam</b>, clearly the top two players Federer and Rafa were going to face each other at finals, it was the most anticipated match, and I was onboard with the hype for two reasons : 
 - <b>Roger Federer</b> was chasing history. If he won he would  tie with <b>Pete Sampras</b> for most grand slams <i>(14)</i> in Mens Tennis.
 - <b>Rafael Nadal</b>, his opponent, wanted to enter into Wimbledon winner's circle after winning <b>French Open</b> for the 4th time. Sports Pundits called him a clay court specialist : <b>King Of Clay</b>. He was chasing a rare French Open - Wimbledon double feat which was rare to achieve as it required player to switch from clay to grass surface. If one plays this sport recreationally or follow pro-tennis matches, he/she would be aware that it is extremely difficult to switch surfaces, adapt and win it all the way is a big bask, and many had failed in the past to win both slams in the same season.  
 
 Finals turned out to be a classic <b>4 hr 48 mins</b> marathon, today it is considered to be one of the best matches witnessed in tennis history. Nadal prevailed, a rivarly was born which continued for decades. These two became tennis role models and fans picked only two sides in tennis either Roger or Rafa.

<b>Novak Djokovic</b> on the other hand just won his first slam that year, <b>Australian Open</b>. He was the first Serbian to win a grand slam (he currently owns 9 titles in AO). 2011 he started started winning more slams, defeating Roger and Rafa in many occasions. Today they are referred to as <b>"The Big 3"</b> of tennis world, sharing total of <b>59 slams !</b>

<h2>Data Analytics Idea</h2>
Analyzing how I can tell a story of the lengends using data analytics? Finally decided it would be best to start simple and gather total titles by year to analyze and project their career graph. To further build a race chart showcasing their progression and succession to the top of the Big 3. Considering several alternatives, ended up using <b>Python</b> as the preferred language to tell this story.

And here is the story ! Slam race from year 2000 - 2021.

<h3>Tennis Grand Slams</h3>
<div class="table-wrapper">
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Total Titles</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

<h2>Why Beautiful Soup?</h2>
<span class="image right"><img src="{{ "/images/BeautifulSoup/BSlogo.jpeg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> 
In order to simulate an accurate trend visual, intent was to get players career data from a reliable source. In this case was it was the official tennis ATP website. The online repository has wide range of historical data for all tennis players. Challenge here was to seamlessly navigate content through web and get desired extracted intormation. Enter Beautiful Soup ! For a quick analytics project turnaround and to scrape literally anything developers give to in-built parser, this library provided by Python is the most diverse package one can ask for, because :
- Beautiful Soup makes page's tree traverse and searching easy.
- This library automatically converts encoding types to best suit developer's need.
- This library sits on top of other Python libraries like <b>lxml</b> and <b>html5lib</b>.

Plenty of big data and data science projects from time to time requires web scraping, and Beautiful Soup library helps developers with that process. Interesting fact, the name of the package was adapted from a song in <i>Alice's Advantures In The Wonderland</i>

<h3>Inspecting Web Page </h3> 

Key to gathering information from web is understanding tree structure of your target webpage. Understanding of page tree elements helps to extract information such as CSS, DOM, query pattern, HTML table content and other elements part of the page. Developers can use any browser tool to get HTML content view, I recommend Chrome's <i>Inspect</i> feature. Right click on the browser and select "Inspect", it opens up developer tool window displaying HTML content. It gets easier to explore and skim down to desired information.

<h3>Data Manipulation & Visualization </h3>
Extracting data from a site majority of time would also require data cleansing and transformation for analytics and visualization purpose.  Example in this article uses pandas, <code>bar_chart_race</code> and <code>pandas_alive</code> libraries to achieve transformation and visualization steps.

<h3>Implementation Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Install required packages using <code>pip install</code></li>
    <li>Initiate URL connection request using <code>request</code> library</li>
    <li>Use beautiful soup library to find html content from the page</li>
    <li>Store extract in Dataframe using <code>pandas</code></li>
    <li>Use race chart and pandas alive library to create a gif and video extract of the data</li>
</ul>
