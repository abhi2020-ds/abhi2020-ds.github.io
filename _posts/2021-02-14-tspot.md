    <blockquote>As per Gartner : As disruptive as visual-based data discovery has been to traditional BI, a third wave of disruption has emerged in the form of augmented analytics, with machine learning (ML) generating insights on increasingly vast amounts of data. Augmented analytics also includes natural language processing (NLP) as a way of querying data and of generating narratives to explain drivers and graphics.</blockquote>

It's highlight feature of being a Search Based Analytics tool (augmented analytics) with a strong recommender system is catching attention across industries. As ThoughtSpot continues to diversify its capabilities further, currently its emphasis is on reporting on cloud datasource, however ThoughtSpot should try to expand data connections to other conventional data sources that industries are familiar with and using at large scale. Also emphasizing on adding more visuals will go long way to compete with competitors PowerBI, Tableau and Qlik. <b>Dataflow</b> is getting there with managing ETL processes internally for the tool, but needs to mature more. Also some level of maturity is needed to improving error classifications for debugging and troubleshooting. </p>
<p>If your data analytics team is transforming into cloud ecosystem then this tool should be considered best option you got apart from PowerBI, Tableau, and Qlik. Data preparation and data load within TS is a topic of discussion for some other time. Overall a thumbs up to this reporting tool and highly recommend fellow data experts to leverage this tool within their industry in some fashion.
