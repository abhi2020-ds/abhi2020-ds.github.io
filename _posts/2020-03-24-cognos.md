## Cognos Vs Other BI Tools
<p>Cognos even though considered one of the earliest pioneers in the field of BI reporting has faced tough competition now as more companies are entering into building BI application. Tableau , Power BI , Qlik View, Google Analytics, and Thoughspot are some of the leading technologies competing with Cognos. </p>
<p>The most important question one needs answered is which tool is the best amongst the pack? Answer is not quiet simple. Depending on your business need your company might prefer one than the other, or if budget permits can buy more than one BI tools to serve the need for different business scenarios. I would try to higlight comparisons between the application and where Cognos still has an edge, and where it lacks compared to its competitors.</p>
