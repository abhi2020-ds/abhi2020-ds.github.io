Technology has been my passion since high school when I stmbled upon my first encounter with computers and Operating Systems : MS DOS and GW Basic language. It was fascinating to see how we can communicate with machines and use it for computing along with experiencing virtual interaction. At home, IBM machine was my frst PC with Windows 98 Operating System installed. As I continued to advance through my technical learning I learnt programming languages such as HTML, C, Java and C++ at an early time. At present, my major area of focus is towards data analytics and engineering using BI platforms like Cognos, ThoughtSpot, and Power BI.
