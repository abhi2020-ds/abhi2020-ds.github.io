I have been working in data analytics, science and engineering space for over 10+ years. I hold a M.S degree in Computer Sc from University Of Illinois, and a bachelors degree in Computer Sc from SJB Institute Of Technology at Bangalore, India. 

Technology has been my life long passion, I stumbled upon computers and Operating Systems quiet early. It was fascinating to see how low/high level languages can communicate with machines and use it for computing purpose. At home, IBM machine was my frst PC with Windows 98 OS. As I continued to advance through my technical learning I learnt programming languages like HTML, C, Java and C++. At present, my major area of focus is towards data analytics and engineering using Business Intelligence analytics platforms like Cognos, ThoughtSpot, and Power BI.

Over the years, working at manufacturing and finance Industries has provided me better understanding of several key business operations. To translate industries business rules into technical solutions sparked deep interest towards exploring more into Business Intelligence technologies.
