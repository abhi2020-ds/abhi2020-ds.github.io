Technology has always been a passion in my life. At high school I was stmbled upon my first encounter with computer and Operating Systems : MS DOS and GW Basic language. It was fascinating to see how one can communicate with machine and use it for computing and virtual interaction experience. At home, first PC we had was an IBM machine with Windows 98 Operating System installed. As I continued to progress towards technical learning I learnt programming languages such as HTML, C, Java and C++ to name a few. At present, my professional journey is mainly inclined towards data analytics and engineering using BI platforms like Cognos, ThoughtSpot, and Power BI.
