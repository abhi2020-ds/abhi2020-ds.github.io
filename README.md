  This GitPage is under construction and would consist of code snippets and concepts around data science and data engineering projects. Technologies used throughout will be traditional SQL, Python, R, Cognos and PowerBI. Once there is a framework built up, I will expand this repo to other applications such as Microsoft 365 Suite Tips and Tricks.

  Feel free to contribute to this page as well as other repositories associated with my git account. Looking forward to exploring world of data science through lens of different technologies.
  
- [x] Modify Readme.md :+1:
- [x] Update the Gitpage
- [ ] Categorize repos based on technologies and languages

# Massively
> This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
